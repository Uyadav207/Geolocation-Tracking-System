# Trackon React Native [ GEO-LOCATION PATH TRACKER ]

The idea is to create an application that keeps track of itâ€™s userâ€™s daily walk, running, hikes etc. The user can store their daily data and even retrieve it whenever they want.
Whenever the user want to have a track of their locations and want to measure distance , speed or directions. We provide them with accurate results. To achieve the objective, this Application is build using Facebookâ€™s mobile application development technology React Native that helps in developing Android as well as IOS applications using same codebase. The application will use mongoDB as Nosql database to keep the track of userâ€™s authentication as well as real-time geolocations by tracking userâ€™s Coordinates, latitude and longitude.
To keep the track of locations and accessing it from database, express server is implemented with the help of frameworks like Express.js and Node.js on backend of this application. To access and penetrating through different data-layers inside the application Redux and Context Api is also used. Proper user Interface along with user authentication is used to provide the best User Experience.
